Install and start your server. [Instructions in this link.](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)

This app is made to work with your server listening in http://localhost:3001, if not, change your port in [Readable API](https://github.com/alxsnchez/readable/blob/master/src/ReadableAPI.js) helper.

After having your server running just type:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

Have fun! :)
